# Mujeebah's Frontend Developer Portfolio

## ðŸš€ Overview

This repository contains the source code for my personal professional portfolio, built with **HTML** and styled using **Vanilla CSS**. The site is designed to showcase my expertise in modern frontend development and UI/UX principles. It's also me literally touching grass, by using only the basic web development requirement.

It is a fully responsive application (SPA) focused on clarity, performance, and accessibility.
